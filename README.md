Workflow

Data Cleaning – Handle missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent formats.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Visualize feature relationships with loan approval.

Feature Engineering – Encode categorical variables, scale numerical features.

Model Building – Train multiple models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.).

Model Evaluation – Use accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC to compare performance.

Final Predictor – Select and tune the best model for deployment.
